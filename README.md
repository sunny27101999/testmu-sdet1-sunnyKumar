SDET-1 | AI-Native Quality Engineering Challenge Assignment

## Project Description
This project is a Java-based test automation framework designed for both frontend (UI) and backend (API) testing. It leverages popular open-source libraries to provide a robust and scalable solution for quality assurance.

## Technologies Used
*   **Java 8+**
*   **Maven:** Project build and dependency management.
*   **Selenium WebDriver:** For automating web browser interactions.
*   **TestNG:** A powerful testing framework for organizing and running tests.
*   **WebDriverManager:** Automatically manages browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver).
*   **Rest-Assured:** A Java DSL for simplifying REST API testing.
*   **ExtentReports:** Generates rich, interactive HTML reports for test execution.
*   **Log4j2:** A flexible logging framework.
*   **Apache Commons IO:** Provides utility classes for I/O operations.
*   **JSON:** For handling JSON data, particularly in API tests.

## Gemini AI Integration (GeminiUtil)
This framework includes `GeminiUtil.java`, a utility class designed to interact with the Google Gemini API for AI-driven functionalities. It enables capabilities such as content generation, data synthesis, and potentially intelligent test data creation or report summarization.

### Configuration
To utilize `GeminiUtil`, you must configure your Gemini API key in `src/test/resources/config.properties`:

```properties
gemini.api.url=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent
gemini.api.key=YOUR_FREE_GEMINI_API_KEY
```
**Important:** Replace `YOUR_FREE_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual Gemini API key. Without a valid key, `GeminiUtil` will not function.

## How to Run Tests

### Prerequisites
*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed.
*   Apache Maven installed.

### Running All Tests
To execute all tests configured in `src/test/resources/testng.xml`, navigate to the project's root directory and run the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn clean test
```

This command will:
1.  Clean the project target directory.
2.  Compile the source code and tests.
3.  Execute tests using the `testng.xml` suite definition.

### Running Specific Tests
You can modify `src/test/resources/testng.xml` to include or exclude specific test classes or methods.

## Test Reports
After test execution, detailed HTML reports generated by ExtentReports can be found in the following locations:
*   **API Test Report:** `testReport/ApiExtentReport.html`
*   **Frontend Test Report:** `testReport/ExtentReport.html`

These reports provide comprehensive insights into test results, including pass/fail status, execution time, and step-by-step details.

## What to Build Next (with more time)

With more time, the following enhancements would further strengthen this test automation framework, with a particular focus on AI-driven improvements:

1.  **AI-powered  Optimization:**
 

4.  **Enhanced Reporting with AI Insights (Accurate Prompts):**
    *   Extend ExtentReports with AI capabilities (using `GeminiUtil` to process prompts) to provide deeper insights into test failures. This could include AI-generated summaries of test runs, root cause analysis suggestions, correlation of failures with recent code changes, and trends in test stability over time. By using carefully crafted prompts, the AI can deliver more accurate and actionable reporting.
